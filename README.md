# Getting Started with Supreme Chess

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Node.js

This project requires an installation of Node.js, which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

# Installing Dependencies

This project requires project-level installation of many dependencies through npm, the Node.js package manager.

To set up the project, follow the instructions here:
1. Navigate to '3XA3-Group2-Chess/' and run 'npm install'.
2. Navigate to '3XA3-Group2-Chess/src/' and run 'npm install'.
3. Navigate to '3XA3-Group2-Chess/src/src/Backend/'. and run 'npm install'.
4. Open Google Chrome and install 'Moesif Origin & CORS Changer', found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc). It is recommended that you only enable the extension while running the application and disable it afterwards.

This will set up the dependencies for the project. To verify the correct dependencies are installed, run npm list and compare it to each package.json file in the directories used in the instructions above.

## Available Scripts

Within '3XA3-Group2-Chess/', the following scripts can be run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Running the Project

In order to run, the project must be running the server in one terminal, and running the react application in another. To do this, follow the instructions here:

1. Navigate to '3XA3-Group2-Chess/src/src/Backend/' and run 'node server.js'. This will run the server.
2. Navigate to '3XA3-Group2-Chess/' and run 'npm start'. This will run the react application and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
