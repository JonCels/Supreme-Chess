\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of testing this system is to detect and correct software failures, increasing confidence that the system was implemented correctly.

\subsection{Scope}

The project, SupremeChess, is a chess game played \sout{online by one player against an AI opponent, or} by two players against each other. The scope of testing for this project will cover three main areas:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The implementation of the chess game logic. This includes testing moves, game states, and game termination.
    \item Surrounding functionality such as the timers, the menu, the chat feature, \sout{and the AI opponent}.
    \item \sout{The online multiplayer functionality against an AI opponent or another user.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview of Document}

The SupremeChess project plans to re-implement the open source project \href{https://github.com/techwithtim/Online-Chess-Game}{``Online-Chess-Game''}. The software will allow users to play chess with anyone on a web server. All software requirements of the project are stated in the Software Requirements Document in the SRS folder of the 3XA3-Group2-Chess Git Repository.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}

The software will allow a user to play a game of chess against another user \sout{online, or against an AI opponent}. The implementation will be completed in JavaScript using Node.js and React.

\subsection{Test Team}

The individuals responsible for testing the system are Jonathan Cels, Rupinder Nagra, and Pesara Amarasekera.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

\sout{Automated testing will be done using the software testing tools specified below, Enzyme and Mocha. The team will write unit tests for React components using Enzyme, and write the test suite using Mocha. Further detail on the unit testing strategy can be found in section 6, the Unit Testing Plan. The test suite will be run after each major commit to the master branch, and will be run before and after merging any branches to ensure that nothing is broken on addition of new components.}

\textcolor{red}{Automated testing will be done using the default jest library installed with create-react-app. However, there is no automated testing required for this system as manual testing is more effective for highly visual components.}

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\sout{Enzyme}}:
        \sout{Enzyme will be the tool used to test React components.}
    \item \textbf{\sout{Mocha}}:
        \sout{Mocha will be used to write the automated test suite.}
    \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Jest} will be the tool used to test React components and will be run using the built-in `react-test script`.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
		
A Gantt chart detailing the project and testing schedule can be found at the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/celsj/3xa3-group2-chess/-/blob/master/ProjectSchedule/3XA3_ProjectSchedule.pdf}{following link}.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

Requirement-driven test cases were named with the following naming convention: T-Req\#-Test\#. T stands for test, Req\# represents a specific requirement, such as FR1 or UH2, and Test\# represents the numbering for multiple tests on the same requirement. Eg. T-FR1-2 represents the second test for functional requirement with ID FR2.

                Type: Functional, Dynamic
                					
                Initial State: Both player boards have been initialized and the game is in play.
                					
                Input: The current player has the first move, or the opponent has made a move.
                					
                Output: The current player is given complete control to the board, and can choose to make any legal move they want. The opponent may not make a move during this period.
                					
                How test will be performed: The system will make the first move for the player with the white pieces. The test is deemed successful if the player is able to do so.

                Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
                					
                Initial State: Both player boards have been initialized and the game is in play.
                					
                Input: The opponent player is to make the first move, or the current user has made their move.
                					
                Output: The current player has been restricted all control to the board, and cannot make any legal move on the board.
                					
                How test will be performed: The system will make the opponent start with the white pieces. The test is deemed successful if the current player, with the black pieces, is not able to make a move on the board before the opponent makes a move.

\subsection{Functionality of Supporting Components}

    \paragraph{Functionality of Chat Option}
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        
            \item{T-PC3\\}
            
                Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual.
                					
                Initial State: A chat has been started between two players.
                					
                Input: A valid input string representing a message sent by one of the players.
                					
                Output: The message should be visible by both players in the chat window.
                					
                How test will be performed: Two team members will start a game with each other and start a chat. One player will send a message in the chat and they will verify that both players can see the message in the chat window. They will also verify that additional messages do not delete previous messages and remain ordered.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

A test that compares the system implementation against the existing implementation is as follows:

\paragraph{Board State Comparison}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item{T-EI-1\\}
        
            Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual.
            					
            Initial State: A game has been started on the system as well as on the existing implementation.
            					
            Input: The same set of valid moves is input into both systems.
            					
            Output: Both systems have the same game state response after each input.
            					
            How test will be performed: Two team members will start a game on the system as well as on the existing implementation. The team members will play the same moves on both systems and ensure the same response occurs on both systems.
			
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
    The Mocha \& Enzyme frameworks will be used to do unit testing for this project. Enzyme will be the utility used to for React that makes it easier to work with React. Mocha will be used to write the test suite.

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

	To create unit tests for the internal functions of the program, the methods with return values can be tested. This process would involve using the methods by providing appropriate input values. Using the expected outputs of these methods, several unit tests will be developed for the system. Such unit tests will attempt to also generate exceptions, along with valid inputs. No stubs or drivers are necessary for testing the system. Enzyme \& Mocha both come with functionality to make imports and tests extremely easy to use. Anything that needs to be imported will already be done by the individual classes. The team goal is to achieve 80-100\% statement coverage and greater than 50\% path coverage.
	
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		

	To develop unit tests that will test the accuracy of our output, the system will provide various chess positions and moves, where they will be compared to the actual and the expected output. To complete this task, the chess application will present a chess position, and a method will confirm if the set of moves provided match the current chess position output. For the tests to be deemed successful, all positions should match the corresponding set of moves. The required library for performing unit testing of outputs files is \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js}{chess.js}.
